![salmon in foil]()

### Preparation (all ingredients to taste)
- roughly 2lb of boneless salmon 
- melted butter or butter alternative
- lemon juice
- olive oil
- salt
- pepper
- garlic powder


### Execution
1. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for about 10-20 minutes. 
2. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. 
3. Line a large baking dish or rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of aluminum foil.
4. Coat the foil with baking spay and place the salmon on top.
5. Take a brush and cover the salmon with olive oil, lemon juice, and butter. 
6. Season the salmon with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. 
7. Fold the sides of the aluminum foil up and over the top of the salmon until it is completely enclosed. If your piece of foil is not large enough, place a second piece on top and fold the edges under so that it forms a sealed packet. Leave a little room inside the foil for air to circulate.
8. Bake the salmon for 20-25 minutes, until the salmon is almost completely cooked through at the thickest part. The cooking time will vary based on the thickness of your salmon. 
9. Remove the salmon from the oven and open the foil.
10. Place back in the oven and broil on LOW for 3 minutes.
